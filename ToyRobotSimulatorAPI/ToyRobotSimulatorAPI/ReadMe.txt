	Toy Tobot Simulator has been created as a .Net Core 2.1 Web API.
	The call to the API can be made from a Fiddler service similar to the example below:

	Example:
	http://localhost/ToyRobotSimulatorAPI/api/toyrobot?request=Place 5,5,North;Move;Report

	Due to time and usability constraints, Authentication of the Web API is not complete.
	Can be worked upon in future development.

	MSTest Fraemwork is used for unit test case creation.
